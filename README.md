# Caltech CS/CNS/EE 155 Miniproject 1: Particle Motion Classification

## Project Overview

This project, part of the Caltech Machine Learning & Data Mining course (February 2023), focuses on the classification of motile and non-motile particles. Our team, KTLJ, utilized a variety of machine learning techniques to tackle this challenge, participating in a Kaggle competition and securing a ranking of 26th on the private leaderboard with an $F_2$ score of 0.83561.

## Key Highlights

1. Models Used: Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost models, emphasizing systematic feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
2. Feature Engineering: Custom and systematically engineered features significantly enhanced our models' predictive accuracy.
3. Model Validation: Employed repeated k-fold cross-validation and grid search for robust model selection based on the F2 score.
